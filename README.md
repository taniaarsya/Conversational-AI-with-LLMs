# Conversational AI with LLMs for Business

This project explores how to create a Conversational AI system using Large Language Models (LLMs) such as OpenAI and HuggingFace, tailored for business applications. It demonstrates how to build intelligent Q&A systems connected to structured and unstructured data sources.

## 🧠 Training Objective

The goal of this module is to introduce the principles, techniques, and best practices for using LLMs to develop robust conversational systems that can enhance business decision-making. Suitable for data scientists, developers, and business professionals looking to integrate AI into real-world use cases.
