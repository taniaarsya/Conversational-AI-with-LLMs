    "\n",
    "We have created a GPT question and answering system using Large Language Models (LLMs) that can generate answers based on our data. Now, let's delve deeper into how LLMs understand natural language by exploring the concept of embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "In natural language processing (NLP), **embeddings** are representations of **words or text as numerical vectors**. These vectors capture the **semantic and contextual** information of the text, allowing the model to understand the meaning and relationships between words. In simpler terms, embeddings help the chatbot understand the meaning of words and how they relate to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you have a chatbot designed to assist customers with their inquiries. When a customer asks a question, the chatbot needs to understand the meaning of the question and provide a relevant answer. This is where embeddings come into play. The chatbot is trained on a large amount of text data and learns to associate words with their respective embeddings. These embeddings encode the information about the words' meaning and context.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if a customer asks, \"What are the payment options available?\" the chatbot uses the embeddings to understand the meaning of the words \"payment\" and \"options\" and their relationship within the sentence. It can then provide an appropriate response by retrieving information from its knowledge base.\n",
    "\n",
    "Embeddings enable the chatbot to **make sense** of the customer's input and generate accurate and contextually relevant responses. By capturing the meaning and relationships between words, embeddings enhance the chatbot's understanding of natural language and improve its ability to generate meaningful and coherent answers."

    "### Basic Concept of Embedding (Vector)\n",
    "\n",
    "A vector (or embedding) is an **array of numbers**. That on its own is exciting, but what is even more exciting is that these arrays can represent more complex data like text, images, audio or even video. In the case of text, these representations are designed to capture **semantic and syntactic** relationships between words, allowing algorithms to understand and process language more effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Word embeddings, specifically, are dense vector representations that encode the meaning of a word based on its context in a large corpus of text. In simpler terms, they map words to numerical vectors in a high-dimensional space, where similar words are located closer to each other. This is done in a vector database (we will talk about this later)\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating these embeddings is done by an embedding model. There are multiple embedding models that can be used. OpenAI also provide embedding model but we will use free LLM model so we don't ran out of credit. We will use **`\"all-MiniLM-L6-v2\"`** embedding model.\n",

       "[Document(page_content='Summary for Australia:\\n\\n- Australia\\'s coal and gas exports may reduce by half within the next five years due to the passing of its peak and the efforts of Asian countries to decrease greenhouse gas emissions. The earnings of minerals and energy exports are predicted to reach $464bn in 2022-23 from $128bn in thermal coal exports and $91bn in liquidified natural gas (LNG) exports. These figures have resulted from the global energy crisis caused by Russia\\'s invasion of Ukraine, leading to high fossil fuel prices, causing the replacement of Russian gas with alternative supplies in northern hemisphere nations. \\n\\n- The seaborne coal market grew by 5.9% year-on-year to 1208 million tonnes in 2022, reversing the negative trend of previous years, according to shipbroker Banchero Costa. Although Australia\\'s coal exports declined by 5% in 2022 due to China\\'s adoption  of alternative markets, relations between the two countries have mended and coal shipments are expected to resume. Indonesia is now the largest exporter of coal globally, with a 32.2% share in 2022 compared to Australia\\'s 28.2%. In terms of export destinations, Japan was the top with 115 million tonnes in 2021, while exports to India rose by 13.6% but declined by 3.3% to China.\\n \\n- Coal producers are in talks with the government of New South Wales, following the government\\'s announcement that coal miners should reserve up to 10% of production for domestic supply to control rising energy costs in Australia. Coal producers are expected to be minimally impacted since spot supplies are limited, limiting requisition under the rule. The state is expanding an existing system that requires some coal-mining companies to reserve supply. Exports of coal are essential to the Australian economy, with 80% of the country\\'s coal exported, yet the move comes as coal prices rise nearly 50% YoY.\\n \\n- After a year of frozen relations between China and Australia, there is hope for a thaw in their relationship. Chinaâ€™s Foreign Minister, Wang Yi, met with a delegation from Australia to mark the 50th anniversary of bilateral relations and stated that the countries have no \"fundamental conflicts of interest\". Australia is hoping to resume trade in commodities such as iron ore and coking coal. While it is still uncertain whether a trade recovery will happen, analysts and experts from both countries have expressed optimism. Trade data shows that in 2021 China has already imported 694 million tons of iron ore from Australia, accounting for 62% of total imports.\\n\\nSummary for Indonesia\\n\\n- Indonesia plans to produce a record 695 million tonnes of coal in 2023 and export 518 million tonnes, according to Energy and Mineral Resources Minister Arifin Tasrif. The country\\'s coal-fired energy supply makes up more than half of its total, though the government aims for a net-zero emissions goal by 2060. Domestic coal consumption in Indonesia is projected at 177 million tonnes this year, down from 193 million tonnes in 2022. \\n\\n- Global seaborne coal loadings increased by 5.9% year on year to 1204.9 million tonnes in 2022, with Indonesia\\'s exports rising by 21.2% to 388.9 million tonnes, according to shipbroker Banchero Costa. The EU\\'s coal imports jumped 33.9% year on year to 116.5 million tonnes, while India took 13.6% more coal from Indonesia, receiving a total of 203.8 million tonnes. Coal shipments to China fell by 3.2% to 234.7 million tonnes, and Australian exports declined by 5.0%. \\n\\n- Ford is investing in a $4.5bn nickel processing facility in Indonesia, in partnership with PT Vale Indonesia and China\\'s Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt, in order to secure a supply of nickel needed for EV batteries. The facility is set to begin commercial operations in 2026 and is expected to help Ford achieve its target of producing around two million electric vehicles in that year. China\\'s services sector reached its highest level in over a decade in March, providing a promising signal for the global economy, which is relying on Chinese consumers to drive growth. Coal prices have continued to fall, with Central Appalachian coal down 57% from the start of the year. \\n\\n- Bank Indonesia predicts that Indonesia\\'s economy will continue to experience strong growth, with a range of 4.5-5.3% expected in 2023, despite global economic uncertainty. The country\\'s economy grew by 5.31% in 2022, driven by a surplus in the trade balance, controlled inflation, increased credit growth, and healthy financial systems. Credit growth is expected to increase by 10-12% in 2023, and increased domestic and export demand are projected to strengthen household consumption and drive economic growth. Non-oil and gas exports, including coal, metal ore, and crude palm oil, have grown rapidly. \\n\\n- Indonesia aims to produce 694 million tons of coal in 2021 to fulfill both domestic and export demands, said the country\\'s Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources. Last year, the nation produced 627 million tons, with 4-5 million tons exported to Europe, compared with 500,000 tons in previous years, the Indonesian Coal Mining Association said. European coal demand is expected to stay strong next year.\\n\\n- Indonesia\\'s new ban on coal exports, implemented to ensure adequate supply for its state-owned electricity companies, is expected to disrupt Supramax and Panamax markets in the Pacific region. The country exports around 400 million metric tonnes of thermal coal each year to countries including China, India, Japan, South Korea and Vietnam. The ban, which has seen bulkers unable to sail out of Indonesian ports, is likely to result in a tonnage surfeit in the Asia-Pacific, leading to lower shipping rates, particularly in East Coast South America (ECSA) and the Indian Ocean. \\n\\nSummary for China:\\n\\n- China\\'s coal industry is expected to see stronger trade as the country ramps up energy supplies and stabilizes prices, with coal accounting for 56% of the country\\'s total primary energy consumption. In July 2022, China\\'s coal and lignite exports rose by 171.6% YoY to 230,000 tons. Indonesia is the largest exporter of coal to China, accounting for 58.3% of total imports, followed by Russia at 23.3% and Mongolia at 10%. Australian coal miners are expected to see a pick up in exports to China, while technology and investment from China is set to play a vital role in Indonesian coal deep-processing. \\n\\n- China\\'s imports of Russian coal rose to 8.54 million tonnes in August due to soaring energy demand caused by extremely hot weather. This trade marked the highest volume since data collection began in 2017, and was up 57% compared with the same period last year. Chinaâ€™s purchase of Russian imports rose by 60% to $11.2bn in August on the back of surging demand for oil, coal and gas. Meanwhile, bilateral trade between China and Russia reached $117.2bn in the first eight months of 2022; up over 31% YoY. \\n\\n- More than 50% of China\\'s coking coal imports this year are expected to come from Mongolia, according to coking coal analyst Li Xiaoyun from MySteel consultancy. Mongolia is projected to export approximately 40m to 50m tonnes of coking coal to China in 2022, making it the largest coking coal seller to China for the third consecutive year after it replaced Australia in 2021, according to MySteel\\'s data. However, China\\'s total shipments for coking coal imports are expected to have a minor increase due to imports growth from Australia and Indonesia, Li added. \\n\\n- China added 38.4 GW of new coal-fired power capacity in 2020, more than the rest of the world combined, according to research by US think tank Global Energy Monitor and the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air in Helsinki. The capacity increase means China has not been cutting emissions despite last year\\'s pledge by President Xi Jinping that the country would be carbon neutral by 2060. The government has come under criticism from environmentalists for allowing coal-fired plants to be built in polluted regions and developing projects in greener areas more slowly. \\n\\n- China increased its coal-fired power capacity by 42.9 GW, or 4.5%, in the 18 months to June 2019, according to a report by Global Energy Monitor. The study also found that another 121.3 GW of coal-fired power plants are under construction in China, which has pledged to reduce its coal usage. However, the countryâ€™s absolute coal consumption has still increased in line with rising energy demand.
